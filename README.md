This repository contains code to run model simulations that reproduce the population, procedures, and outcomes of the MTN-020/ASPIRE trial, including 2,614 women confirmed HIV-1-negative at enrollment. This model was used to evaluate the protective effect of a dapivirine vaginal ring for HIV-1 prevention among women engaged in both vaginal and anal intercourse. Results are reported in the forthcoming peer-reviewed manuscript “Dapivirine ring HIV-1 prevention effectiveness for women engaged in vaginal and anal intercourse: insights from mathematical modeling”.
